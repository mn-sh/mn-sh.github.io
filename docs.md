## What is Dexter Finance
Dexter Finance is a DeFi protocol on Fantom which lets you earn fixed yeild on your digital assets. Dexter also allows users to tokenise and trade future yeilds on their tokens. It is completely decentralized hence users don't have to trust any third partiy and can keep complete custody while having their assets work for them.
 - Set & Forget
 - Stable & Predictable returns
 - Attractive to new investors and institutions

**How to get started with Dexter Finance.**
First, you need a wallet that supports Fantom Blockchain and FTM to pay for the gas fee for your transactions. You also need to have the asset in your wallet that you want to earn yield on. For setting up Metamask for Fantom, [check here](metamask.com)

**How to buy discounted assets (Earn Fixed Rate)**
Choose the base asset that you want to earn fixed rate yeilds on, select the term period and purchase discounted principal tokens. In case you don't have an asset supported on Dexter yet, you can use AMMs like [Sushi](sushi.com), [Spookyswap](spookyswap.com), etc and perform a swap. [^1]

**How to get fixed yield**
The user earns fixed rate by buying *Principal Tokens* at discounted rate. When the term ends the user can redeem the tokens 1:1 to the base asset. So let's say if a user buys the token at 3% discount with a maturity of 6 months, he will get 6% APR on his principal. The later the date of maturity, the more is the discount that the principal token will have and hence a larger yeild.

**How to Withdraw**
A user can withdraw his principal tokens when the term ends at par as the base asset. Alternatively they can also withdraw before the term ends in the secondary markets. See [Pools](our custom AMMs pools)

**Minting Principal & Yeild Tokens**
Minting is the process of depositing assets and getting yeild and principal tokens in return. Because the yeild is also tokenized users gets pricipal token which represents his deposit amount as well as yeild tokens tracking the current variable yeild on his assets.

**Providing Liquidity**
User having PTs or YTs and the base asset can provide liquidity in a custom Beethoven-X pool and can earn extra yeild. See [Uniswap](Uniswap LP Articile)
